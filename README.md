Each method has sort of pseudocode on how I decided to tested each method.
 
I decided to do all my testing in JUnitCollectionTesting.java.

I initialized all the collections and initialized each collection with 3 elements to each collection.
So, for each @Test method, I knew I had 3 elements to work with.

The first 10 test methods contain testing for Set, Linked List, and Hash Map methods that contain the same method name
(i.e. size, remove, etc.).

And then, I separated the testing methods for Stack, Queue, and any Hash Map testing that I did not do before.
